### Battleship but in the 80s and in space!

This is our submission for the Turing School of Software and Design Mod 1 pair programming project.

The program was built in Ruby 2.7.2 and runs a game of battleship in the terminal.

The user is presented with prompts to set a custom board size, place their two ships on their board, and is presented with an empty board for their opponent - representing the coordinates they can fire upon.

The computer player chooses random, non-repeating, cells from the player's board to fire on, and the first to sink both ships wins and ends the game.
